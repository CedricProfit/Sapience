Calculating Profit
==================

Sapience Digital Financial Network is a high interest rate proof-of-stake decentralized crypto currency network.  Our total coins to be mined via proof-of-work mining is taken from the golden ratio, an interesting number that some believe humans naturally seek out.

Sapience offers a 1,618% annual interest rate, with a 618 coin cap on the stake reward per block.  The reward cap encourages breaking unspent outputs into smaller units for a better distribution of coin weight and smoothing the effects of large wallets coming on and off of the network.

Sapience is released with two core purposes:

1. Provide a platform for evaluating the code optimizations we have implemented, particularly as regards maps and iteration.
2. Build features external to the wallet that bridge to the web and promote awareness and interest.
